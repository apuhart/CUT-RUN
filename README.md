# CUT&RUN Analysis Repository

This GitHub repository is dedicated to performing **CUT&RUN (Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease)** analysis using the **Greenlist normalization** approach. This method is based on the work described in the paper:

**Fabio N de Mello, Ana C Tahira, Maria Gabriela Berzoti-Coelho, Sergio Verjovski-Almeida**  
_The CUT&RUN greenlist: genomic regions of consistent noise are effective normalizing factors for quantitative epigenome mapping_

## Overview

The repository contains the code, scripts, and methods for processing and analyzing CUT&RUN sequencing data using a novel **Greenlist normalization** strategy. This approach leverages specific genomic regions identified as consistent sources of noise across various CUT&RUN experiments, providing an effective and reproducible method for normalization. The Greenlist approach allows for more accurate quantification of chromatin features by reducing experimental biases.

### Key Features:
- Scripts for data processing and normalization of CUT&RUN data
- Implementation of the Greenlist method for normalization
- Tools to handle CUT&RUN sequencing outputs and statistical analysis
